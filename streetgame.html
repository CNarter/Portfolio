                    <p class="project-overview">As part of a recent Project Management Bootcamp, I was asked to design a project, and I came up with creating a Worthing Street Game. The idea is a fun, interactive street game, playable on any mobile device, 
                        showcasing interesting historical and architectural places in Worthing. The project would create an enjoyable, interactive, multiplayer game playable over a small, accessible, mapped area in central Worthing. 
                        It would include 10-15 interesting clues to solve, covering facts, views, architectural, or historical places that are always visible and not dependent on seasons, weather, or regular changes/closures. 
                        The 'journey' would be on foot, and I took care in planning to ensure it's accessible. I thought about possible monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play, and considered that in the project and build design</p>
                   <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interactive map with a flat, accessible route, including the museum, pier, and cinema, with no steps and with safer road crossing spaces.</li>
                        <li>Location-based puzzles and clues designed around permanent landmarks in Worthing.</li>
                        <li>Future potential for 'side quest' add-ons and monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play.</li>
                        <li>Designed to be inclusive and accessible, including features for disabled access and 'changing places' toilets.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Skills demonstrated</h4>
<p>
    This bootcamp was a great exercise, refreshing and renewing skills I've built over my career (and building my confidence in my existing knowledge), and adding new aspects of project management that I hadn't previously had exposure to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Project design, scoping, and setup.</li>
    <li>Stakeholder management and engagement.</li>
    <li>Risk management and mitigation planning.</li>
    <li>Strategic planning and SWOT analysis.</li>
    <li>Content creation, including writing clues and photographing locations.</li>
    <li>Monitoring and evaluation planning, including setting up analytics and feedback mechanisms.</li>
    <li>Agile project management methodologies.</li>
    <li>Collaboration and teamwork in a bootcamp environment.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The design includes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>A detailed project plan outlining the scope, objectives, and deliverables.</li>
    <li>A risk management plan to identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies.</li>
    <li>A stakeholder engagement plan to ensure community involvement and support.</li>
    <li>A content creation strategy for developing clues and puzzles.</li>
    <li>A monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the project's success and impact.</li>
</ul>
