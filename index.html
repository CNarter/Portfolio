                        <p class="tagline">Account, Service and Digital Project Manager</p>
                        <p>I'm a friendly and pragmatic all-rounder, looking for a great team of creative people doing interesting work, for good.</p>
                        <p>With decades of Account and Service management experience, including running the Support service in a 'tech for good', digital agency for four years, and a year in a SaaS
                        start-up, focused on improving fairness in hiring, I am commercially and technically astute, a creative problem solver and enjoy a role where I can get involved on various levels, and learn new skills.</p>
                        <p>I'm returning from a (health drama - now fully resolved) career break. During my break, I completed a Digital Project Management Bootcamp (accredited by the APM) to polish my 'on-the-job' skills,
                            and am currently attending a Software Development course at Brighton MET, partly for interest and to better understand testing, simple fixes, and of course, developer teams. 
                            I'm also learning British Sign Language</p>
                        <p>I would love to find a team in Brighton where I can use my skills and add value.</p>

                            <p class="project-overview">As part of a recent Project Management Bootcamp, I was asked to design a project, and I came up with creating a Worthing Street Game. The idea is a fun, interactive street game, playable on any mobile device, 
                                showcasing interesting historical and architectural places in Worthing. The project would create an enjoyable, interactive, multiplayer game playable over a small, accessible, mapped area in central Worthing. 
                                It would include 10-15 interesting clues to solve, covering facts, views, architectural, or historical places that are always visible and not dependent on seasons, weather, or regular changes/closures. 
                                The 'journey' would be on foot, and I took care in planning to ensure it's accessible. I thought about possible monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play, and considered that in the project and build design</p>
                           <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Interactive map with a flat, accessible route, including the museum, pier, and cinema, with no steps and with safer road crossing spaces.</li>
                                <li>Location-based puzzles and clues designed around permanent landmarks in Worthing.</li>
                                <li>Future potential for 'side quest' add-ons and monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play.</li>
                                <li>Designed to be inclusive and accessible, including features for disabled access and 'changing places' toilets.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Skills demonstrated</h4>
                            <p>This project covered all aspects of the project lifecycle:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Project Management: Managed the entire project independently, logging all hours worked against planned future income using a time-tracker in Monday (my PM tool). Created a dummy budget plan to demonstrate a structured approach.</li>
                                <li>Content Creation: Defined the route, photographed "answers" to clues, and wrote clues and solutions.</li>
                                <li>Mapping & Accessibility:Created a mapped area considering accessibility, ensuring a flat and inclusive route.</li>
                                <li>Stakeholder Management:Identified and engaged with key stakeholders including Adur & Worthing Council, Creative Waves, Town Center Bid Association, local businesses like time4Tech, and the Selden Residents Association.</li>
                                <li>Risk Management:Conducted a comprehensive risk analysis, identifying potential issues such as changes to the ActionBound application, poor connectivity, and user interest, with mitigation plans in place.</li>
                                <li>Strategic Planning:Conducted a SWOT analysis, highlighting strengths like individual project control and existing knowledge of Worthing, and identifying opportunities for future AI integration and monetization.</li>
                                <li>Monitoring & Evaluation:Planned to build a shareable webpage, create social media channels, set up monitoring via GA and HotJar, and collect feedback via Typeform to measure success against gameplay and sponsorship goals.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Technologies & Tools Used:</h4>
