                            <p class="project-overview">The Worthing Street Game is a fun, interactive street game, playable on any mobile device, showcasing interesting historical and architectural places in Worthing. The objective is to create an enjoyable game playable over a small, accessible, mapped area in central Worthing. It includes 10-15 interesting facts, views, architectural, or historical places that are always visible and not dependent on seasons, weather, or regular changes/closures. The 'journey' is on foot, ensuring accessibility for most people. Future monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play is being considered in the build and design, though making money is currently excluded from the project's scope.</p>
                            <p class="project-overview">Expected delivery for the game is Summer 2026.</p>

                            <h4>My Contributions:</h4>
                            <p>This project is being run solely by me, giving me full control, flexible deadlines, and agility in responding to changes. My contributions span all aspects of the project lifecycle:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>**Project Management:** Managed the entire project independently, logging all hours worked against planned future income using a time-tracker in Monday (my PM tool). Created a dummy budget plan to demonstrate a structured approach.</li>
                                <li>**Content Creation:** Defined the route, photographed "answers" to clues, and wrote clues and solutions.</li>
                                <li>**Mapping & Accessibility:** Created a mapped area considering accessibility, ensuring a flat and inclusive route.</li>
                                <li>**Stakeholder Management:** Identified and engaged with key stakeholders including Adur & Worthing Council, Creative Waves, Town Center Bid Association, local businesses like time4Tech, and the Selden Residents Association.</li>
                                <li>**Risk Management:** Conducted a comprehensive risk analysis, identifying potential issues such as changes to the ActionBound application, poor connectivity, and user interest, with mitigation plans in place.</li>
                                <li>**Strategic Planning:** Conducted a SWOT analysis, highlighting strengths like individual project control and existing knowledge of Worthing, and identifying opportunities for future AI integration and monetization.</li>
                                <li>**Monitoring & Evaluation:** Planned to build a shareable webpage, create social media channels, set up monitoring via GA and HotJar, and collect feedback via Typeform to measure success against gameplay and sponsorship goals.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Technologies & Tools Used:</h4>
