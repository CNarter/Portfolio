                            <p class="project-overview">As part of a recent Project Mangement Bootcamp, I was asked to design a project, and I came up with creating a Worthing Street Game. The idea is a fun, interactive street game, playable on any mobile device, 
                                showcasing interesting historical and architectural places in Worthing. The project would create an enjoyable, interactive, multiplayer game playable over a small, accessible, mapped area in central Worthing. 
                                It would include 10-15 interesting clus to slve, covering facts, views, architectural, or historical places that are always visible and not dependent on seasons, weather, or regular changes/closures. 
                                The 'journey' would be on foot, and I took care in planning to ensure it's accessibile for most people. I thought about possible monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play, and considered that in the project and build design</p>
                           <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Interactive map with a flat, accessible route, including the museum, pier, and cinema, with no steps and with safer road crossing spaces.</li>
                                <li>Location-based puzzles and clues designed around permanent landmarks in Worthing.</li>
                                <li>Future potential for 'side quest' add-ons and monetization via sponsorship or pay-per-play.</li>
                                <li>Designed to be inclusive and accessible, including features for disabled access and 'changing places' toilets.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Skills demonstrated</h4>
                            <p>This project covered all aspects of the project lifecycle:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Project Management: Managed the entire project independently, logging all hours worked against planned future income using a time-tracker in Monday (my PM tool). Created a dummy budget plan to demonstrate a structured approach.</li>
                                <li>Content Creation: Defined the route, photographed "answers" to clues, and wrote clues and solutions.</li>
                                <li>Mapping & Accessibility:Created a mapped area considering accessibility, ensuring a flat and inclusive route.</li>
                                <li>Stakeholder Management:Identified and engaged with key stakeholders including Adur & Worthing Council, Creative Waves, Town Center Bid Association, local businesses like time4Tech, and the Selden Residents Association.</li>
                                <li>Risk Management:Conducted a comprehensive risk analysis, identifying potential issues such as changes to the ActionBound application, poor connectivity, and user interest, with mitigation plans in place.</li>
                                <li>Strategic Planning:Conducted a SWOT analysis, highlighting strengths like individual project control and existing knowledge of Worthing, and identifying opportunities for future AI integration and monetization.</li>
                                <li>Monitoring & Evaluation:Planned to build a shareable webpage, create social media channels, set up monitoring via GA and HotJar, and collect feedback via Typeform to measure success against gameplay and sponsorship goals.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Technologies & Tools Used:</h4>
